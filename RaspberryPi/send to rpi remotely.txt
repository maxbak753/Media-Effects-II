How to send a file from a remote computer to the raspberry pi via SCP (Secure Copy Protocol):

Template:
scp [source file] [pi username]@[pi IP address]:[remote path]
Example:
scp "C:/path/file.txt" maxbak753@maxrpi:/home/maxbak753/Desktop

This can fix errors if remote host identification has changed:
ssh-keygen -R [pi IP address]
